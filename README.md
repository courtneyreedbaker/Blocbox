#Blocbox
##### The project created for Bloc and was described as follows: "We have won a contract to work with a new startup named "Blocbox". Blocbox is a SaaS (Software as a Service) web application which allows people to collect information and store it in a single place. A person can create simple documents, store images, links to websites, and collaborate with others."
#About Bloc
##### Bloc is a programming bootcamp whose students attend from the comfort of their homes and at less than half the price of Bloc's conventional competitors. Bloc pairs its students with professional mentors. Our mentors are active developers who pair-program with, and instruct our apprentices in the nuances of software development.
